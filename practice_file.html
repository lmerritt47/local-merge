<p>So I asked Bob about quotations on the Web and he said <q>I know as much about quotations as I do about pigeon fancying</q>. Luckily, I found HTML Dog and it said:</p>

<blockquote cite="http://www.htmldog.com/guides/html/intermediate/text/">
<p>blockquote and q are used for quotations. blockquote is generally used for standalone often multi-line quotations whereas q is used for shorter, in-line quotations.</p>
